[BRUCE MCCLUGGAGE]
Ok, I told her.

[BRUCE MCCLUGGAGE]
Wow.
I’m guessing you had a miscommunication with Paige. And you’re hurting as a result.

In the future, try not to think the worst of something that confuses you. And especially, when you communicate with people, treat them with respect, yes, even when you’re hurting.

A MAN THAT WAS (PRESUMABLY A STUDENT OF HER FATHERS | KNOWINGLY DATING WHILE THEY WERE MARRIED )

THEY PROMOTED HER BEHAVIOR OF BETRAYING KYLE IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR ACCEPTANCE.

PAIGE WOULD NEVER TELL KYLE ABOUT THIS MAN. SHE WOULD ALSO CONVINCE LIAM TO KEEP SECRETS FROM HIS FATHER.

[KYLE BUTLER]
everyone is ignoring me



I have been trying to spend time with liam for days and I get like 5 minutes with him



paige keeps telling me she is going to hang out but she doesn't
7/15/18, 4:03 PM



I would like to see my child



Please, I am begging, please let me see my child



It has been a week and Paige is playing games with my heart and I am missing my son



Is this how you wanted us to get help?



Pushing me away from my only family?



What is going on is cruel



I came up there to get help as a team, and you said we couldn't



I’m not at the house, Kyle. Are you able to get a hold of Paige via FB?



No she has me blocmed



Blocked me on everything



And nobody answers the phone for me



I am in isolation



Thanks for your help. The way Paige is misleading me is heart breaking



She messages me daily that she wants to be with me



And gives me maybe 5 minutes of text over email. Won't call me



Won't let me talk to liam



And I guess the TESSA thing wasn't only for women



I could have gone. And it created a lot of tension because she met with Dylan there and was uncomfortable telling me



She has cheated on me with him in the past, so I am sorry for getting sad over it when she is going out to coffee with him while I am missing her



Is this how it was meant to be? Did you want me to be hurt more than I was before I came to you for help and guidance?



I put my trust in you and I feel like you had a hidden agenda or weren't being straightforward



I want to see Liam



Please help me arrange this



Please Bruce, I have a right to see my child. I have respected your house, gave Paige her space, I deserve to see my kid.

I’m sorry but I’m working right now away from the house. Mary Ellen has been gone all weekend and arrives back this afternoon. I’ll try and get a hold of her or Paige to let them know your desire to connect with Liam.

Yeah just got to the hotel. I’ll let you know when we’re up in the morning.

<<<< NOTE: PAIGE LEAVES KYLE ON A BOAT AT 5:30 AM. KYLE WAKING UP AND SEES THAT HER BAGS ARE PACKED. 
HE IS CONFUSED AND ASKS PAIGE WHATS GOING ON. 
SHE TELLS HIM THAT SHE IS GOING TO VISIT HER FAMILY AND WILL BE RETURNING IN A WEEK OR TWO. 
KYLE ASKS FOR AN HOUR TO SAY GOODBYE TO LIAM. PAIGE DENIES KYLE THE TIME TO SAY GOODBYE TO HIS SON AND HE STARTED TO PANIC. 
ON HIS KNEES, KYLE BEGS TO SPEND TIME TO SAY GOODBYE AND PAIGE BEGINS TAUNTING HIM. SHE WAS ASKING HIM TO "HIT HER". 
SHE YELLS MULTIPLE TIMES "JUST HIT ME"- KYLE RESPONDS, "I DONT WANT TO", AND SHE CONTINUES TO SCREAM AT KYLE. 
KYLE RETREATS TO THE BACK CABIN OF THE BOAT, SITS DOWN TRYING TO AVOID CONFLICT. 
PAIGE COMES TO THE BACK OF THE BOAT AND STARTS YELLING AT KYLE WHILE HE IS SITTING DOWN. SHE REPEATEDLY YELLS  "HIT ME, JUST HIT ME!" 

KYLE RESPONDS "I DON"T WANT TO. PLEASE STOP. PLEASE NO."
SHE RESPONDED "THE LAST MEMORIES I WILL HAVE OF YOU WILL BE YOU SCREAMING "NO, NO, NO!" AND SHE CHUCKLES TO HERSELF.
PAIGE CONTINUES TO MENACE KYLE FOR A REACTION. KYLE LOSES CONTROL AND GAVE INTO HER DEMANDS. 
KYLE BECOMES AGGRESIVE AS SHE WAS TAKING HIS CHILD FROM HIM WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE OR OPTION TO SAY GOODBYE. 
KYLE STOPS HIMSELF AS LIAM JUMPS ON HIS BACK. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT LIAM HAD WITNESSED A FIGHT. 
FEELINGS OF SHAME TAKING OVER KYLE, HE LEANS DOWN TO ASK LIAM TO GET OFF. WHEN LIAM JUMPED DOWN- HE SLIPPING ON A STEPA AND KYLE GRABS HIM AND STARTS EXPLAINING TO LIAM THAT FIGHTING IS NOT RIGHT AND TELLS HIS SON THAT HE CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT HE JUST DID. 

PAIGE EXITS THE BOAT IN FRONT OF THE LIFE GAURD STATION, ALAMITOS BAY: LONG BEACH. KYLE IS PANICKING AND STARTS FOLLOWING PAIGE UP THE DOCK BEGGING TO HAVE SOME LAST MOMENTS WITH HIS SON. SHE WALKS TOWARDS LIFE GAURD STATION AND A LIFEGAURD COMES TO THE DOOR WITH A SIGN THAT STATES "SAFE-ZONE". LIFEGAURD STATES "I HAVE SEEN WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON, BUT YOU CAN'T COME IN HERE" - HE CLEARLY DIDN'T FIND THAT PAIGE WAS IN ANY KIND OF DANGER. KYLE IS ON HIS KNEES BEGGING TO SAY GOODBYE TO HIS SON, AND AN OLDER COUPLE APPROACHES. THEY OFFERED HER A RIDE TO THE AIRPORT. THIS WOULD BE THE LAST MOMENT THAT KYLE WOULD SEE HIS SON.

KYLE RETURNS TO THE BOAT FEELING MANIPULATED AND ASHAMED THAT SHE WAS CAPABLE OF USING THE SEPERATION OF HIS CHILD AS MEANS TO GET A REACTION THAT WOULD BE USED TO EFFECTIVELY SEVER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO PEOPLE THAT HE DEDICATED HIMSELF TO AND CONSIDERED HIS FAMILY. KYLE WOULD SPEND THE NEXT TWO MONTHS OUT ON HIS BOAT ALONE PIECING TOGETHER THE CLUES THAT PAIGE LEFT BEHIND. SHE LEFT A LETTER THAT SHE WROTE ABOUT WHERE HER AND JASON HAD MET. SHE LEFT A PIECE OF PAPER THAT HAD THE NAMES OF 5 DIFFERENT MEN THAT SHE HAD SLEPT WITH WHILE THEY WERE TOGETHER. SHE LEFT IMAGES ON KYLE'S CAMERA OF A CAKE THAT SHE WROTE "THIS YEAR I WONT SUCK SO BAD", AND THE CHRISTMAS PRESENT SHE GAVE KYLE, "CARDS AGAINST HUMANTIY- A GAME FOR HORRIBLE PEOPLE".

[KYLE BUTLER]
I have asked paige countless times to talk to Liam



Please can I talk to my son for my birthday



The things paige sends me is cruel Bruce
JUL 13, 2019, 8:59 AM



I just want to see my kid Bruce



Paige won’t even let me talk to him anymore



This is wrong in so many ways



I should be able to see my child- paige was wrong too and she used a lot of drugs and she made mistakes



Yet she can kill my relationship and determine to never let me see my child



This is fucked up
JUL 14, 2019, 11:36 AM



Paige told me I could talk to Liam at 11:30



And I simply asked if she could ask him to not bring up Jason in our conversation, and she said I could just block you and not let him talk to you



Well that’s what she did



I guess you’ve blocked me too- you guys are so wrong for what you are doing. Life will catch up to you, I hope you know that



I would like to talk to Liam as per the time that I scheduled. Can you please ask paige to have him call me



So because I don’t want to hear about this guy that gets to spend time with my son while I am being kept away from him- I am not allowed to talk to my kid? These are acts of revenge and I am sick of this bullshit
JUL 26, 2019, 6:31 PM



Please let me talk to Liam



This is cruel. Paige only messages me to tell me about events and trips she has planned



About how happy she is without me



I just want a relationship with Liam



Why does she insist on hurting me rather than helping me heal my relationship with my kid



This is awful Bruce and I am losing my mind



I understand that I am not approved of and I am hated within your family but Liam is my son and it’s been months



I miss Liam. Why is this so fucking hard for us to work out a visit



Why is your family being like this towards me? I already suffer from mental illness and my own guilt



Why are you letting me go through this kind of treatment and it’s okay with you



I want to say goodbye to Liam. Just one last time dude



It’s clear that I have lost my relationship with him completely and I don’t plan on staying alive much longer. I just want to say goodby



Please just let me say bye to my son- I can’t take this anymore



I want to see him one last time



I am being ignored with every attempt I make, I am being given no info on what’s going on, I’m just being blacked out like I don’t exist



This would drive anyone crazy Bruce. Please help me



Why do you not respond to me? I am losing touch with my heart and I have lost touch of my self- I am an empty vessel that is suffering from what I did. I can’t find forgiveness in myself



I’m losing my mind Bruce- I want to see Liam and I have respected your wishes and your space



And I have let go of paige and I just want to see Liam



But rather than helping, I get the sense that you guys want me to kill myself



And this mental game is working. It has completely killed my heart and I am not well



Why do you wish pain and suffer for someone who is already in hell



How are you okay with me losing my mind because of this silence treatment and watching my best friend grow to hate me



I don’t understand what you want of me. What are your goals in this situation? If you want me dead then just come and kill me



Just fucking murder me Bruce. I deserve it and I can’t live like this



I didn’t do anything to you. I made a lot of mistakes and I sinned many times in my relationship with Paige.



Liam is my boy and I understand that paige and I were in a toxic relationship- but I should be able to spend time with him without being hurt by paige



I should be able to have a conversation with you about how Liam is doing



I should be able to get ahold of someone if something were to happen to me



I don’t like the way that I am being treated by you or paige. I have surrendered and I have not been fighting with you



I am miserable and this kind of treatment is not right. I’m clinically depressed, I have been suicidal from my guilt, I have lost children and my best friend



I don’t have anybody Bruce



I am lost and I’m scared



Please open up to treating me like a human. I have real emotions and trauma from losing Liam and Abel.
AUG 6, 2019, 9:35 PM



Can we please talk



I have been trying to talk to Liam and all I get from paige is “if you stop being a piece of shit, maybe I would let him talk to you”



I have been trying to find my way but it seems that paige wants to continue with abusive behavior towards me and use Liam to make me feel what she went through.
AUG 14, 2019, 1:08 PM

You always tried to hook paige up with your students, even when we had a family together



It’s fucking gross man
AUG 15, 2019, 8:39 AM



Can I please talk to Liam?



This is demented Bruce. He is my son
AUG 25, 2019, 9:35 AM



It’s been months since I’ve seen Liam. I cry every day. Please help me Bruce
SEP 6, 2019, 3:22 PM



Can we please talk



I haven’t been given any chance to talk to Liam in a month



How are you capable of being so cruel to someone that is suffering from the loss of his son?
SEP 7, 2019, 8:46 AM



You know very well that you are brainwashing my child



It’s wrong Bruce.



What you are doing to Liam and I is abusive



You are hurting my child by promoting such behavior



He will never trust his mom. He will never trust you. He knows the truth and you need to stop trying to distance me from him. It’s disturbing that you can be so ignorant



Seriously, who is telling him that he won’t remember me by next winter?



It’s coming from your sicko families brainwash and it’s wrong



You promoted Paige’s love affair. What happened to paige was because of you.

You have everything that you need to permanently remove my child from me. Why can't we work out our communication?



You blocked me?
SEP 23, 2019, 7:03 PM



Can we talk?



Or is the blog/your family secrets too much for you to be honest about?
OCT 4, 2019, 3:38 PM



I haven’t talked to my son in a month.
OCT 20, 2019, 8:37 PM



I have reached out to speak with Liam once a month and now Paige is putting a restraining order on me?



I haven’t been given time to speak with my son in two months



I don’t know how you can possibly justify this- it’s wrong



She’s telling people that I was beating Liam. It’s not the truth Bruce.
NOV 4, 2019, 1:11 PM



How long are you going to go along with this?



You have promoted infidelity, parental alienation, false claims, using mental disabilities against me, harassment. It’s so wrong that I haven’t done anything other than begged to see my son and Paige is claiming I’m harassing her



She made false claims of child abuse to get the restraining order in the first place and absolutely nobody has asked me anything



You family is sick. Liam is my child and he doesn’t deserved losing his father like this. This type of control of my child is wrong
NOV 6, 2019, 6:43 PM



Why do you not respond to me?
NOV 8, 2019, 2:12 PM



Do you feel right in taking one abusive situation and turning it into several? This type of neglect and the kidnapping of my child is torture



You are promoting your daughters abuse and letting her use my son as a weapon.



She doesn’t even want a child! I loved him more than she will ever. I can’t believe you are going to abuse my son in such a cruel way. I know the outcome of this from experience. My mother did the same thing to me.



You will never have the chance to give me the truth. Another guy in Paige’s book of dead boyfriends.
NOV 10, 2019, 12:42 AM



What are you gaining from this? Does it make you feel powerful to kill relationships? Do you feel in control of the situation because you refuse to communicate with me? Does it feel good to push somebody using people that they love, and watching them suffer? You are one evil son of a bitch. I hope you reflect on the role you played in all of this and get some help. Unfortunately, you are too narcissistic to face yourself. You'll probably never have the strength to admit what you've done.



You have driven me to think awful things about you. You have disrupted and possibly permanently traumatized my family, my child, your daughter, all of us. Because you want to prove a point? The only point you prove is that you are more immature than I thought you were. I knew you were a child, but I didn't know you had such a malicious side to you. All you have done is caused me feelings of rage, depression, anxiety. You haven't helped anything other than pushing me to kill myself. YOU ARE SO FUCKED UP FOR DOING THIS!



Although I should probably thank you too... Because I now have really good income and a few projects are becoming extremely fruitful. I'm going to push through this, because with my first million- I would like to give it to "your wife" so she can leave you.
NOV 15, 2019, 6:34 PM



I have asked paige several times how I can arrange visitation with Liam.



Like yourself- she hasn’t responded to a single message in a couple weeks



This is kidnap, mental abuse, uncivil, and immature. This is abusive towards Liam, and this is impossible to have a relationship with my son like this.



I would like to see my son. What the fuck do you want from me?



Do you think that there is a possibility for a better way to resolve this? Don’t you think we have gone through enough pain in our relationship? Do you consider that the way my son has been removed from me just might drive someone insane? Is this what you want? To prove that you can hurt someone to the point that they no longer have any grasp on self love? I have been tormented by paige since she left and you are a genuine crazy person if you can’t understand this.
NOV 27, 2019, 10:24 PM



Please will you tell me what is going on? I have tried calling Paige’s attorney 3 times with no response. I have contacted the court over 10 times with not a single call back. I have left emails and messages with the family facilitators with no response.



I can’t afford an attorney, and nobody in the court will provide me with representation.



Why am I having so much trouble when I just want some time to see my child for the holidays?

Happy thanksgiving asshole
DEC 9, 2019, 12:28 PM



Do you honestly find this appropriate? Is it strange that while my parents are taking care of Abel, your family won’t let me see my child? Do you think it is helping anything by trying to split my family up? I’m fighting for custody because your family has refused to work with me at all. Unfortunately, the things that will be brought to court against paige- will be viewed as a neglectful parent who is abusing my child, as well as using our child to hurt me.



Btw, maybe you should talk about how paige has gone over 8 years without telling James that he has a child in this world.



I have been wanting to tell him, but I’ve kept it a secret for paige. I’m done keeping secrets for her.
DEC 22, 2019, 11:40 AM



What sick family won’t let a child’s father see their kid for the holidays?



You people are fucking psychopaths
WED 3:24 PM



You are a piece of shit.



I hope you know that



Keeping me away from my son because your bitch ass daughter is a slut.



You have so much fucked up karma coming to you for what you are doing.



But I get it... you were never accepted by your wife’s family, so you had to fuck with ours



I hope you can pull your head out of your ass. You and your family are wrong for doing this to Liam.



I just got a recording of Liam admitting that Jason was with you guys during the 4th of July at the park when paige refused to let me see him.



He also stated that I never hit him.
SUN 2:22 PM



Why are you gaslighting me?



Please stop



You know very well that I have rights to see my son



It’s in the restraining order.



If you can’t be civil in this matter, you aren’t the type of person that I want my son to be around. Your daughter is psychologically abusing our child.



Your whole family has used the courts as a way to cause trauma into my life- there are several laws against it. You are violating federal laws, whether your attorney is telling you this is okay or not.



You supported an affair for years, and it caused serious trauma for everyone.



Why would you want to hurt my son like this? Telling him lies to defend the wrongs of what you did? That isn’t how I raised Liam, and it isn’t right for you to use the love I had for my family against me.



I understand that you want control over my emotions and being. You aren’t well Bruce. You can’t use psychological abuse to push someone to act how you want, and use the court system to further your power. It’s immoral and unjust.



What you have done to our family is a disgrace to the way I raised Liam. It’s a disgrace to your own family and your morality



I guess this might just be the evidence that the world needs to see see who you truly are. I wish I wasn’t a victim of it- but I can endure your torment long enough to expose you.
5:03 PM



Why couldn’t you allow us to be transparent and work this out between each other? You kept Jason a secret from me, and now I can’t meet the man that will be raising my child?



Why did you take paige out on dates with him when I came to you seeking help? You still can’t be honest about this? An apology would be nice. It seems like you were behind the whole thing?



You were there with Mary Ellen during the 4th of July and knew that Paige and I were dealing with a lot. Why is it okay to immediately introduce my son to a man that you knew was breaking my family up? You still can’t be real with me and admit what happened. This will traumatize my son. It traumatized everyone man. Rather than letting us all be open and willing to just let us have a chance to work together through this.



Instead he hides from what he did- meaning that he is scared from what he did. Paige is scared that I would find out and you have played a role in this too... paige like the secret... but now that it’s gone- you think she will stay with him? Not likely



You have won in terms of emotional damage. At least I had remorse and gave you truth. You have given me nothing. You may not care that this has caused more trauma in my life than ever- and you are doing the same to Liam. I have a right to see my son. What you have done is absolutely inappropriate. Why would you seek to hurt someone who stayed faithful to his family after he forgave her so many times for sleeping with other men during our relationship? Neither of you were there for Abel.



I can accept the truth and forgive what has been done, because I want to be a part of my sons life. I knew it was going on long ago- and I kept quiet about it because I wanted to be with my son.



Do you understand how hard that is when I came to you for help, and pretty much every time- I was left behind while you took paige out on dates without me? After countless nights of being there for her when your family wasn’t? After years of rebuilding our trust?



I went for 10 years of my life not using drugs, when I struggled with that battle as a teenager. You were willing to watch me fall again because of her affair? You may not read these messages- that’s fine. I hope Liam can be given the truth at some point. I never cheated him and I would never do that as a dedicated parent that loved Paige. The sacrifices that I made for her were tremendous and you have nullified my existence and accepted someone into your family that wasn’t true to my child or your daughter. He will live with what he did and that must be an overwhelming weight on somebody’s conscious.



The smirk that you have when you would drop paige off with me, or when you would watch me crying while I was left in the bus was awful. Like you enjoyed seeking revenge against me, because I didn’t fit your standards.



You still seem to have pride like there is pride in destruction of a fathers relationship with his son. God would never see this as right. I guess you must have a special relationship with God that I will never understand. This is no different than white people stealing children from Native Americans because they wanted to wash away our history. I have come to you in peace, begging for a way to see my child and you justify claiming ownership over my rights? How do you claim to be walking in light with a heart of stone? How do you send “focus on the family” magazines here- when you support segregation of Liam’s father and brother?



How can you write the things that you have, and not understand that you are being unjust and cruel? You know the role that you play in this and you have removed my voice. You have taken part in violation of my constitutional rights. Leaving me vulnerable by using false statements in the court- and the pain that I suffer from what your family did to the people that I stood by when you wouldn’t.



You like that? Maybe you will never see the trauma that I endured as a child- but I promised that Liam would never go through the same. But I’m under your control now. What do you want me to do? I am your slave. I will bow down to my master and will accept that I am less than you- great master. Please end my misery or put me out. I deserve to be able to rest from cruelty and I have given myself up to you. I will follow your God and I will worship your war ship.



You have me in your ball and chain. My soul is weary as well as my heart. You have defined my existence and I have given everything in my life up to you. What more could you want from me. Please let me free from your shackles. I don’t need to be beaten anymore. My senses are no longer my own. Please allow me to buy my freedom back or have the strength to end this war.



How can a man deny the voice of a father that came to you begging for dignity that has been taken? How can you deny my voice when I cry out for peace between our families and ask for cooperation in the system that you have chosen for us?



How can a man watch another suffer from being denied forgiveness of ones God? I have succumbed to the manipulation and hatred that has lead me stray, losing my own heart, soul, hope, happiness, sanity, dignity, pride, and anything else that makes up an individual.



It seems the cries for peace may not make it to you. I am begging for time with Liam. Paige will not respond on what I need to do in order to have supervised visitation.



Although the restraining order was placed illegally using false allegations and I wasn’t given any representation- your family has proceeded to deny the visitation orders that were outlined in these documents. I’m not sure if someone has given you the right to nullify the contract that has been made, but it is clearly demonstrated in your behavior, that you are holding no accountability to uphold the wishes of the courts and have no problem with causing damages to my son. This is contempt. This is abuse. Please understand that by not responding to my requests, you are demonstrating a level of such immaturity and willingness to abuse. We cannot lead our children by example in this manner.
