# Narcissistic

I will be sharing a brief overview of the federal crimes that have been looked over due to an unfair lack of representation.

This repository contains the many text messages that Kyle Butler sends begging to see his child, Liam Butler. The McCluggage family has denied him to have a voice and we love to watch him lose his mind because we wan't to relace him. It is also known that if his son were to go with him, the "secrets" would be exposed, and they would be found guilty on several different levels. But whoops... the secrets already out.

If you check out the repository "Statuates and Legal Proceedings", we have made many notes on rights violations as well as federal crimes that we really should consider taking into consideration. For some reason, the family is abusing a child and his father in an extremely cruel way. It must be this abusive behavior (aka personality disorder) that Kyle Butler can't seem to accept.

In the "DIRT" repository, you will find the many unusualy inhumane ways that we have ignored Kyle Butler's request to see or be a part of his sons life. There is also plenty of images from the messages that Liam's mother has sent him, because she can't come clean and take accountability for her secrets.

In the "Pictures" directory- we have posted the pictures that Kyle has with his son. It demonstrates the time and love that they shared with eachother.
