# Narcissistic
A short introduction to PHIL101 for 2020! Thank you for visiting, 
I will be sharing a brief overview of the federal crimes that have been looked over due to a personality disorder that I am suffering from.

If you check out the repository "Statuates and Legal Proceedings", I have made many notes on rights violations as well as federal crimes that we really should consider following. For some reason, our family is abusing a child and his father in an extremely cruel way. It must be this personality disorder that I can't seem to accept.

In the "DIRT" repository, you will find the many unusualy inhumane ways that we have ignored Kyle Butler's request to see or be a part of his sons life. There is also plenty of images from the messages that our daughter has sent him, because she can't come clean with her secrets.

In the "Pictures" directory- we have compared the pictures that Kyle has with his son, to the amount of pictures that Bruce, Paige, and Mary Ellen have with Liam. Most of the pictures that they have of Liam, were in fact taken by Kyle.
